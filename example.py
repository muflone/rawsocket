    About
    ~~~~~

    A pure python ping implementation using raw socket.


    Note that ICMP messages can only be sent from processes running as root.


    Derived from ping.c distributed in Linux's netkit. That code is
    copyright (c) 1989 by The Regents of the University of California.
    That code is in turn derived from code written by Mike Muuss of the
    US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory in December, 1983 and
    placed in the public domain. They have my thanks.

    Bugs are naturally mine. I'd be glad to hear about them. There are
    certainly word - size dependenceies here.

    Revision history
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    November 1, 2010
    Rewrite by Johannes Meyer:
     -  changed entire code layout
     -  changed some comments and docstrings
     -  replaced time.clock() with time.time() in order
        to be able to use this module on linux, too.
     -  added global __all__, ICMP_CODE and ERROR_DESCR
     -  merged functions "do_one" and "send_one_ping"
     -  placed icmp packet creation in its own function
     -  removed timestamp from the icmp packet
     -  added function "multi_ping_query"
     -  added class "PingQuery"

    May 30, 2007
    little rewrite by Jens Diemer:
     -  change socket asterisk import to a normal import
     -  replace time.time() with time.clock()
     -  delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
     -  in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

    November 22, 1997
    Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
    what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
    put in what I need now.

    December 16, 1997
    For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
    this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
    Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
    bytes always and then do an htons().

    December 4, 2000
    Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
    unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.
